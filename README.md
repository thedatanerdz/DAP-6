Problem statements
Customer segmentation of bike companies  to help marketing teams target customers better. 

Data Description
The different metrics of the customers considered were:  marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home owner, cars, commute distance, region and age. The ID numbers were linked to unique customer IDs assigned to leads generated by the marketing team. 

Methods
Data cleaning was performed and duplicates were removed. Data manipulation was performed because of ambiguity regarding the Gender metric ‘M’ for Male and the Marital status metric ‘M’ for married. The age category was split into three groups in order to simplify the data visualizations. The three groups were separated into three age brackets. One age bracket was from 0 to 30 called “Adolescent”, another age bracket called “Middle Age” was from 31 to 55 and the third age bracket called “Old” was all ages above 55. The main metrics that determined the purchase of a bike was Income, Commute Distance and Customer Age. Data set is here. 

Results
Ideal customer profile
Customer commute: 0-1 Miles
Age bracket: Middle Age

Conclusion
